The kingdoms seen in Daniel's vision of the immense image were:
- **Gold head**: Babylon
- **Silver torso**: Medo-Persia
- **Copper Belly and thighs**: Greece
- **Iron legs**: Rome and the Anglo-American duel power
- **Mixed iron and clay feet**: Mix of authoritarian and weakened governments (as they are obliged to listen to their people)
- **Cut stone**: God's Kingdom that will crush all Kingdoms
Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, Anglo-America, Mix of iron-like and clay-like governments and finally God's Government
